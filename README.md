# RBAC Todo App (Role-Based Access Control)

This is a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Todo App** built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and an in-memory database. The app includes authentication, authorization, and role-based access control, allowing different levels of permissions for **Admins** and **Users**. Admins can manage users and tasks, while users can manage their own tasks and view tasks shared with them based on permissions.

## Usage Workflow

1. **Register Users**:
   - Admin: Password must start with `admin` (e.g., `admin123`).
   - User: Use any password.

2. **Log In**:
   - Get a JWT token after login.
   - Use the token in the `Authorization` header (`Bearer <token>`) for all protected routes.

3. **Create Tasks**:
   - Admin can create public or shared tasks.
   - Users can create private tasks.

4. **View Tasks**:
   - Users see their own tasks.
   - Admins see all tasks.

5. **Manage Users** (Admin Only):
   - Promote or demote users.
   - Delete any user.

6. **Log Out**:
   - Use the `/api/auth/logout` endpoint to invalidate the token.

## Testing with Postman

### Authorization
- Use the `Authorization` tab in Postman.
- Select "Bearer Token" and paste the JWT token received after login.


## Future Improvements
- Add persistent storage using a database (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL).
- Implement email verification for registration.
- Enhance UI for better user experience.
